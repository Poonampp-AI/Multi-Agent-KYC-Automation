# Multi-Agent-KYC-Automation
(LangGraph + GPT-4o): Faster TAT &amp; improved compliance  in onboarding &amp; validations.
🚀 Overview

The GenAI KYC Automation System is a multi-agent, RAG-enabled solution built using LangGraph, LangChain, OpenAI, and Python.
It automates KYC verification and document analysis by combining intelligent document extraction, semantic validation, and regulatory compliance checks.

The system ingests and analyzes diverse customer data sources (ID proofs, address documents, financial records, etc.), performs entity verification, and generates compliance summaries with human-review support.

🧩 Tech Stack

Frameworks: LangGraph, LangChain, Python (multi-agent architecture)

LLM Backend: Azure OpenAI (GPT-4 / GPT-4-Turbo)

Retrieval Engine: FAISS / Azure Cognitive Search (Vector DB)

Data Sources: KYC forms, PAN/Aadhaar, bank statements, utility bills, watchlists (OFAC, PEP, etc.)

UI Layer: Streamlit / FastAPI (configurable interface)

Storage: Local + cloud-based document repositories

Version Control: GitHub

✨ Key Features

🔍 Multi-Agent Workflow: Planner, Extractor, Validator, and Compliance Checker agents collaborate for parallel task handling.

📄 Document Understanding: Parses PDFs, images, and text-based KYC forms with metadata extraction.

🧠 Entity Recognition: Identifies and cross-verifies customer names, addresses, and financial IDs.

🧾 RAG-Based Verification: Uses retrieval-augmented generation to cross-check entities against external data (e.g., sanctions lists).

🧑‍💼 Human-in-the-Loop Review: Supports manual review of flagged or ambiguous cases.

🔐 Compliance Checks: Automatically validates data against AML/KYC regulations.

🧠 Summarized KYC Profiles: Generates concise reports with key extracted attributes and confidence scores.

🗂 Audit Trail Generation: Maintains an interpretable log for regulatory audits.

⚙️ Configurable Pipelines: Modular structure for financial institutions, fintechs, or enterprise onboarding systems.

🔄 Continuous Learning: Feedback loop retrains components for improved accuracy over time.
